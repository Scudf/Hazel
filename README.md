Hazel is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented, however (almost) everything inside this repository is being created within YouTube videos, found at [thecherno.com/engine](https://thecherno.com/engine). 

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended with toolset v143, Hazel is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

## Install 

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:
```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Scudf/Hazel.git
```
Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

* Run scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat
